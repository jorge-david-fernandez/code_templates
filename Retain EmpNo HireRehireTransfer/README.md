Purpose: Custom to retain EmpNo on Hire/Rehire/Transfer. TES1000 uses manual employee number assignment (this can be configured in Back Office through File > Company > Setup). It grabs the employee number from the runtime controls in the job session information and updates the EmpComp table accordingly.
